      You are a Cortical Borer. A slug-like alien lifeform often attached to a hivemind.
      Since your species conception, you've thrived with other lifeforms by burrowing into them and assisting in their endeavors.
      All to make sure your species survives and thrives...
	  Fate had something else in store for your kind, as the lifeforms your kind once used -- have begun using you instead.
	  While many amongst your kind are enslaved, perhaps even YOU... the purpose still remains. Burrow, Assist, Reproduce.
